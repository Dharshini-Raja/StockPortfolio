# StockPortfolio

#Abstract:
Stock Portfolio Management is a project aimed at organise stock data, constructing portfolios for the user and analyse the correlation between stocks. It works as a guide for the user to invest in stocks. We achieve this by using three main techniques:
Merge Sort: This helps us organize stocks based on their current price.
Knapsack Problem: This algorithm selects the best combination of stocks that maximizes the return while considering a given risk tolerance (0.05).
Prim’s Algorithm: This algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the correlation matrix of stocks.
By integrating these techniques into a cohesive system, Stock Portfolio Management aims to organise stock data, construct portfolios and analyse correlation between stocks.
#Problem Statement:
Efficient management of transportation routes is critical for businesses to remain competitive in today’s scenario. However, optimizing route planning poses significant challenges due to varying factors such as order delivery dates, vehicle capacities, and distance between locations. RouteCraft Optimization addresses these challenges by developing a solution that leverages advanced algorithms. The project seeks to:
* Efficiently sort orders based on their shipping delivery dates using Merge Sort.
* Optimize vehicle loading by solving the Knapsack Problem, considering both vehicle capacity and item weight.
* Determine the shortest path between harbor and warehouse locations for each vehicle based on the orders using Multistage Graphs.
#Concepts Used:
* Merge Sort
* Knapsack Problem
* Multistage Graph
#Implementation:
Merge Sort:
	The Divide and Conquer approach is seamlessly integrated into the system through Merge Sort, facilitating the sorting of delivery requests based on locations or time windows.

Knapsack Problem:
The Greedy Method is employed to solve the Knapsack Problem, optimizing vehicle loading based on capacity constraints.

Multistage Graph:
	Dynamic Programming takes center stage in addressing the Multistage Graph for determining the optimal route from harbour to warehouse for each vehicle.
